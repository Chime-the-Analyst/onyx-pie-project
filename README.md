# Project Name: Onyx Pie Challenge

 Maven analytics brought out a project for March 2022, the Onyx Pie Challenge. I didn’t take part in it in march. I jumped on it around April and I started writing articles in May. So here’s the documentation of the project.

# Data cleaning

 So first off, I downloaded the dataset and opened it on excel.

 I noticed the dataset had like inconsistent font style, which was very distracting. so I highlighted everything and changed the font style to times new roman. (no serious reason. I just find times new roman easier to read.)
