# Project Name: Onyx Pie Challenge

 Maven analytics brought out a project for March 2022, the Onyx Pie Challenge. I didn’t take part in it in march. I jumped on it around April and I created my github in July. So here’s the documentation of the project.

# Data cleaning

 So first off, I downloaded the dataset and opened it on excel.

                                         Dataset Overview

 I noticed the dataset had like inconsistent font style, which was very distracting. so I highlighted everything and changed the font style to times new roman. (no serious reason. I just find times new roman easier to read.)

                                       Dataset the way I like
                                       

 Then I looked through the dataset to get a feel of it. I noticed it had a quantity and cost column. So I decided to make a total column to signify the total amount of money made per order.

                                      Dataset with Total Column
                                      
# Questions that needed answers
 This project was the first project that I had to think of the questions on my own. I normally answer questions that have been drafted out. So I set out my questions and also researched on what people did on their own projects.

 So I wanted to find out:   
* Total number of orders
* Total quantity produced
* Total amount of money made
* Which day of the week has highest sales
* Which month had highest sales
### Peoples preference:
* Which pie was the most preferred
* Whether people preferred organic or non-organic


# Totals
I found out that there were 2773 orders,8333 pies sold and 353.45k made

                                       Total quantity, orders and amount of money made
                                       
# Period that had the highest sales
I found out that Saturday had the highest sales and April was the month with the highest sales
