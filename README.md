# Project Name: Onyx Pie Challenge

 Maven analytics brought out a project for March 2022, the Onyx Pie Challenge. I didn’t take part in it in march. I jumped on it around April and I created my github in July. So here’s the documentation of the project.

# Data cleaning

 So first off, I downloaded the dataset and opened it on excel.

                                         Dataset Overview


 I noticed the dataset had like inconsistent font style, which was very distracting. so I highlighted everything and changed the font style to times new roman. (no serious reason. I just find times new roman easier to read.)

                                       Dataset the way I like
                                       


 Then I looked through the dataset to get a feel of it. I noticed it had a quantity and cost column. So I decided to make a total column to signify the total amount of money made per order.

                                      Dataset with Total Column
  
  
# Questions that needed answers
 This project was the first project that I had to think of the questions on my own. I normally answer questions that have been drafted out. So I set out my questions and also researched on what people did on their own projects.

 So I wanted to find out:   
* Total number of orders
* Total quantity produced
* Total amount of money made
* Which day of the week has highest sales
* Which month had highest sales
### Peoples preference:
* Which pie was the most preferred
* Whether people preferred organic or non-organic


# Totals
I found out that there were 2773 orders,8333 pies sold and 353.45k made

  Total quantity, orders and amount of money made
  
  
# Period that had the highest sales
I found out that Saturday had the highest sales and April was the month with the highest sales

# Peoples preference
People preferred whole pies to sliced pies, preferred organic to in organic and preferred pre ordering than in store and apple and strawberry were the most preferred flavors.

# Recommendations
* The company should increase production of apple and strawberry pies because they have the most orders.
* The company should increase production on Saturdays because that's the most profitable day and they should stop opening on Sundays because that's the least profitable day. Moving resources to Monday may increase customers on Monday because they haven't had pie since Saturday.
* The company should focus more on whole pies, organic and pre orders because these are more preferred by customers.
